# CSE 15L: Logging into your CSE 15L ieng6 account 

## Intro:

Hello! My name is Brian Ponce and I am a Mathematics-Computer Science (MA30) major located in Warren College (go Bearls!). 

In this lab report, I will be going over the following:

* How to reset your CSE 15L Spring 2023 UCSD account password
* Installing Bash and VS-Code and how you can use both to log into your ieng6 account

## Step 1: Getting That CSE15L Account Password Reset

What most incoming CSE 15L students don't know is that you have a specific UCSD Account for this course. 

To access this username, you must go to this [UCSD log-in page] (https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
