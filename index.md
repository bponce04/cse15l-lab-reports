# CSE 15L: Logging Into Your CSE 15L ieng6 Account 

## Intro:

Hello! My name is Brian Ponce and I am a Mathematics-Computer Science (MA30) major from Warren College (go Bearls!). 

In this lab report, I will be going over the following:

* How to install and set up Visual Studio Code and Git Bash
* How to connect to a remote server using your ieng6 account
* Using remote server commands (and tring them out!)

*Note: Before starting on the first step, make sure that you have already reset the password to your UCSD CSE 15L account. If not, please use the [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view?usp=sharing) by the CSE 15L team to do so.

## Step 1: Setting up Visual Studio Code and Git Bash

After resetting your CSE 15L account password, let's set up the following programs: Visual Studio Code and Git. Setting up these programs will allow us to log-in to our ieng6 accounts.

1) Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and Git (Bash) [here](https://gitforwindows.org/). You will be using both Visual Studio Code and Git (Bash) to log-in to your ieng6 account.

2) To use Git's Bash terminal in Visual Studio Code, use the Crtl+Shift+P shortcut to open a settings menu at the top of the program window. Next, type in "Select Default Profile," make sure you choose Git Bash as your default terminal. This will make it easier to open up the Git's Bash terminal when opening a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.

Doing so will set Git Bash as your default terminal when opening a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.

## Step 2: Getting Into The Remote Server (SSH)

Once you have Visual Studio Code and Git Bash set up, it is finally time to log in to your ieng6 account. 
  
1) Open up a new terminal in Visual Studio Code. Make sure that you have Git Bash as your default terminal, if not look at the second sub-step in Step 2.
  
3) Once you have the Git-Bash terminal open in Visual Studio Code, type in the following command: `ssh`, with your CSE 15L account username afterwards with the address `ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Your input at this point should like this: 

   `ssh cs15lsp23<insert your unique 2 characters here>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` 

You will then recieve a message asking if you want to continue the connection. Make sure to type in `yes` to proceed. After typing in yes, you will asked to type in your **new** CSE 15L account password 

*Note: Your password will not be visible when you type it in*.

Afterwards, you should see this message indicating that you were able to log in to your ieng6 account.

If everything was successful, then you have officially connected to the remote server with your ieng6 account! 

*Note: If you were not able to log in to your ieng6 account, make sure that you:*

* typed in your password correctly. 
* You typed in ieng6.ucsd.edu 
* You copy and pasted your CSE 15L account password without any spaces before/after your actual password.

## Step 3: Using Remote Server Commands

Once you have your ieng6 account (if not, please look at the prior steps above), we can now try some commands in Git Bash! Below are a few notable commands that we can use (and their function):

* `cd`: Changes a terminal's current working directory
*  `ls`: Lists all the files inside a directory
*  `cp`: Creates copies of files or a directory
*  `cat`: Prints out the contents of a file in a directory
*  `pwd`: Prints out the full path of a directory
*  `mkdir`: Creates directories

Here is an example of one of the commands being used:

Feel free to play around with these commands and learn what each of them do!

## Ending Remarks:

Congratulations, you just logged in to your ieng6 account! With this tool, you will be able to log in to the Computer Science and Engineering building lab computers down in the basement. Your ieng6 account will be useful for future labs in CSE 15L.
