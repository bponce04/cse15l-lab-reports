# CSE 15L: Logging into your CSE 15L ieng6 account 

## Intro:

Hello! My name is Brian Ponce and I am a Mathematics-Computer Science (MA30) major from Warren College (go Bearls!). 

In this lab report, I will be going over the following:

* How to reset your CSE 15L Spring 2023 UCSD account password
* Installing Bash and VS-Code and how you can use both to log into your ieng6 account

## Step 1: Getting That CSE15L Account Password Reset

What most incoming CSE 15L students don't know is that you have a specific UCSD Account for this course. 

1) To access this username, you must go to the Account-look up page (https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and sign in with your UCSD AD username (e.g brponce) and your PID (e.g A12345678).

2) After you log-in, you should be able to see your CSE 15L account username below the subheading **Additional Accounts**
