# CSE 15L: Logging into your CSE 15L ieng6 account 

## Intro:

Hello! My name is Brian Ponce and I am a Mathematics-Computer Science (MA30) major from Warren College (go Bearls!). 

In this lab report, I will be going over the following:

* How to reset your CSE 15L Spring 2023 UCSD account password
* Installing Bash and VS-Code and how you can use both to log into your ieng6 account

## Step 1: Resetting your CSE 15L Account Password

What most incoming CSE 15L students don't know is that you have a specific UCSD Account for this course. To reset your account password you must procede with the following:

1) To access this username, you must go to the [Account-look up page](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and sign in with your UCSD AD username (e.g brponce) and your PID (e.g A12345678).

2) After you log-in, you should be able to see your CSE 15L account username below the subheading **Additional Accounts.** By clicking on your CSE 15L account username, you will be directed to another page, in which it will ask you to change your global password at the near top of the page. Click on the link prompting you to change your password to reset your CSE 15L's account password. Be sure to use [this step-by-step guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view) provided by CSE 15L team for more guidance in regards to resetting your CSE 15L account password.

## Step 2: Setting up Visual Studio Code and Git (Bash)

Once you are done resetting the password to your CSE 15L account, you must then set up the programs Visual Studio Code and Git so that we are able to log-in to your ieng6 account.

1) Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and Git (Bash) [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).
